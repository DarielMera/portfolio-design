    "bio": "I am very fortunate to have worked in so many different fields. From Banks to the Hospitality Industry. However, I have concluded that coding is my true passion. I love to think and that great intrigue and satisfaction of looking for solutions to problems. \n After refining my education by completing an updated Software Engineering Career Course at Boca Code, I seek never to work again in my life (as they say out there) since I will dedicate myself to what I am really passionate about, coding.",
